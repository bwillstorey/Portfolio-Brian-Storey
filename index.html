                            <p class="text-secondary">I grew up outside of Atlanta spending much of my time playing baseball and tennis. I also was in several bands playing guitar. 
                                I was always interested in both sports and music, hobbies which I continue to this day. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-secondary">
                                I attended the University of Georgia, studying Finance, Music Business, and Leadship. I made to jump to Nashville to pursue a career in the music industry. 
                                After several fast-paced years, I moved into the financial sector working with Deloitte in their forensic investigations division. 
                                Presently, I work at UBS leading the MIS Analytics team in the Financial Crime Prevention sector. I enjoy deep data analytics and am fascinated with the insights data can bring to light.
                                I am concurrently studying at Vanderbilt University as part of their flagship software development cohort. 
                                The gradute level program is a joint venture between the Engineering school and Owen Graduate school of Management focusing on 
                                HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and Git.
                                The experience has been challenging but very enjoyable.
                            </p>

                            I currently live in Nashville with my wife Daina and our dog Maximus. We love the music scene here, enjoy travelling internationally, and being outdoors. We recently were scuba certified and got to experience the amazing dive sites in Grand Cayman. In my spare time, I enjoy playing Xbox and watching UGA football.
